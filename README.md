# CSC221-etscar-GroupProject
Web-Scraping Project 

### GitHub repository for CSC221 Group Project (Wake Tech CC)
#### Project Owner Name & Email: 
* **Evan Scarborough, escarborough@my.waketech.edu_**
#### Project Description: 
* This is Evan's group project repository for Advance Python Programming (CSC221). It hosts the project's web scraping program. This project is split into two (2) parts. In Part 1, Evan will create a Web Scraping program modeled after the program developed in Lesson 8 (Lab8). In Part 2, Evan and Kate will “swap” their Web Scaping code with each other and add code to use the data collected to create a plot/graph that appropriately displays the data. Evan isn't entirely sure if the third-person perspective is appropriate or weird.
